A collection of 7 fun browser games and demos built with React, CSS Modules, React Router and Vite.

## 🎮 Mini Games

1. **Star Match**: The player has to repeatedly pick a combination of one or more numbers that sum to the number of stars, until all the numbers are consumed.
2. **Color Match**: The game UI will present the player with two randomly selected colors. For example, green and red. The first color is always rendered with black 
ink while the second color is rendered with a third random color value. The challenge is for the player to determine if the meaning of the first color word 
matches the ink color of the second word. This is not as easy as it sounds.
3. **Target Sum**: The user has to pick a combination of numbers that sum up to the Target sum.
4. **Memory Challenge**: A grid-based memory challenge game where the player is challenged to recall the locations of cells on a grid.
5. **Tic Tac Toe**: An interactive 2-Player tic-tac-toe game with an additional ability to “go back in time” to the previous moves in the game.
6. **Kanban Board**: A Simple Task Management Kanban Board app built using the incredibly extensible `react-beautiful-dnd` library by Atlassian.
7. **Todos App**: A Classic Application to manage your daily workflow. Add/Delete todos seamlessly. Stores user data in localstorage for persistence.
